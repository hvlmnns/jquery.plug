# Plug.js

Plug is a function to create jQuery plugin Prototypes on the fly.

***

Once youâ€™ve created a plugin, you have global access to it.
That means you can use Methods of one Plugin in an entirely different one.
That lead to less code and better usability of snippets.

For having an overview of the used plugins, you can access them via
    $.sockets
